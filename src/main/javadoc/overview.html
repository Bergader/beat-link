<p>A library for synchronizing with beats from Pioneer DJ Link equipment.</p>

<p>Overview and installation instructions are found on the <a href="https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link"
                                                              target="_blank">Project page</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The top level package {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink} provides classes for finding a DJ Link network,
    watching for devices to appear and disappear on it, and creating a {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.VirtualCdj}
    which can obtain more detailed information about what other players are doing, like their current tempo, pitch,
    playback state, which player is the current tempo master, and the source and database ID of the currently-loaded
    rekordbox track. See the {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.CdjStatus} class for more details.</p>

<p>The classes in the {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.data} package can augment this low-level information with
    rich details about the track metadata, including album art, cue point locations, beat grid, and waveforms, both
    the whole-track preview, and full detailed waveform for scrolling through. The
    {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.data.MetadataFinder} is the main coordinator for obtaining and caching this
    information, and it keeps track of the track metadata for all tracks loaded on decks, either for current playback,
    or as hot cues. It also supports creating metadata cache files to avoid the need to query players for this
    information during busy shows with a full complement of four CDJs.</p>

<p>The metadata queries are performed with the help of the {@link org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.dbserver} package,
    which knows how to locate and communicate with the database servers running on the players.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>This project is based on research performed with <a href="https://github.com/brunchboy/dysentery"
                                                       target="_blank">dysentery</a>,
    and the <a href="https://github.com/brunchboy/dysentery/blob/master/doc/Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">packet
    analysis</a> resulting from that project (also available as
    <a href="https://github.com/brunchboy/dysentery/raw/master/doc/Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">downloadable
        PDF</a>).</p>

 <p>An good example of an application built using this library is
