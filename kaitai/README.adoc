If you are looking for the Kaitai Struct Templates that are going to
be used by Beat Link to parse rekordbox media exports, they have been
moved to their https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/crate-digger[own

This folder will be going away shortly, but is here for a few days to
help interested people find where the templates have moved. Please
update your bookmarks!
