  This is a relational database format designed to be efficiently used
  by very low power devices (there were deployments on 16 bit devices
  with 32K of RAM). Today you are most likely to encounter it within
  the Pioneer Professional DJ ecosystem, because it is the format that
  their rekordbox software uses to write USB and SD media which can be
  mounted in DJ controllers and used to play and mix music.

  It has been reverse-engineered to facilitate sophisticated
  integrations with light and laser shows, videos, and other musical
  instruments, by supporting deep knowledge of what is playing and
  what is coming next through monitoring the network communications of
  the players.

  The file is divided into fixed-size blocks. The first block has a
  header that establishes the block size, and lists the tables
  available in the database, identifying their types and the index of
  the first of the series of linked pages that make up that table.

  Each table is made up of a series of rows which may be spread across
  any number of pages. The pages start with a header describing the
  page and linking to the next page. The rest of the page is used as a
  heap: rows are scattered around it, and located using an index
  structure that builds backwards from the end of the page. Each row
  of a given type has a fixed size structure which links to any
  variable-sized strings by their offsets within the page.

  As changes are made to the table, some records may become unused,
  and there may be gaps within the heap that are too small to be used
  by other data. There is a bit map in the row index that identifies
  which rows are actually present. Rows that are not present must be
  ignored: they do not contain valid (or even necessarily well-formed)
  data.

  The majority of the work in reverse-engineering this format was
  performed by @henrybetts and @flesniak, for which I am hugely
  grateful. @GreyCat helped me learn the intricacies (and best
  practices) of Kaitai far faster than I would have managed on my own.

      The database page size, in bytes. Pages are referred to by
      index, so this size is needed to calculate their offset, and
      table pages have a row index structure which is built from the

      value.
