## Installing

Beat-link is available through Maven Central, so to use it in your
Maven project, all you need is to include the appropriate dependency.

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/beat-link/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/beat-link)

Click the **maven central** badge above to view the repository entry
for beat-link. The proper format for including the latest release as a
dependency in a variety of tools, including Leiningen if you are using
beat-link from Clojure, can be found in the **Dependency Information**
section.

If you want to manually install beat-link, you can download the library
from the [releases](https://github.com/brunchboy/beat-link/releases) page
and put it on your project&rsquo;s class path.

## Usage

See the [API Documentation](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/)
for full details, but here is a nutshell guide:

### Finding Devices

The [`DeviceFinder`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/DeviceFinder.html)
class allows you to find DJ Link devices on your network. To activate it:

```java
import org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.DeviceFinder;

// ...

  DeviceFinder.start();
```

After a second, it should have heard from all the devices, and you can
obtain the list of them by calling:

```java
  DeviceFinder.currentDevices();
```

This returns a list of [`DeviceAnnouncement`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/DeviceAnnouncement.html)
objects describing the devices that were heard from. To be find out
immediately when a new device is noticed, or when an existing device
disappears, you can call
[`addDeviceAnnouncementListener`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/DeviceFinder.html#addDeviceAnnouncementListener-org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.DeviceAnnouncementListener-).

### Responding to Beats

The [`BeatFinder`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/BeatFinder.html)
class can notify you whenever any DJ Link devices on your network report beats occurring:

```java
import org.deepsymmetry.beatlink.BeatFinder;

// ...

  BeatFinder.addBeatListener(new BeatListener() {
      @Override
      public void newBeat(Beat beat) {
         // Your code here...
      }
  });

  BeatFinder.start();
```

The [`Beat`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/Beat.html)
object you receive will contain useful information about the state of the
device (such as BPM) at the time of the beat.

> To fully understand how to respond to the beats, you will want to create a
> [`VirtualCdj`](http://deepsymmetry.org/beatlink/apidocs/org/deepsymmetry/beatlink/VirtualCdj.html)
> as described in the next section, so it can tell you important
> details about the states of all the other players, such as which one is
> the current tempo master.

:point_right: To be finished!
